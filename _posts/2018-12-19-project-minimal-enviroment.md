I've been experimenting with minimalistic enviroment for daily use. What I mean by that is that I have been testing how to live without DE or WM...  Here is some of my notes, I will add more to this post later.


## Some console based programs for minimalistic taste:

	- Music: CMUS (Needs Alsa to have sound without DE).
	- For "multitasking": Screen (For example to run music on the background while browsing web.
	- Web Browser: Links or Lynx
	- text editor: VIM or Nano (I prefer VIM)

## Questions:

	1. Is there a working terminal client for Discord?
